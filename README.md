Weather Forecast Android Application
This Android application provides users with real-time weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data. Below is a guide on the design, implementation, and features of the application.

User Interface (UI) Design
Current Weather Display:

Utilize TextViews and ImageViews to visually represent current weather information.
Include temperature, weather description, and weather icon.
5-Day Forecast:

Implement a RecyclerView with CardViews to display the forecast for the next 5 days.
Show date, weather description, min/max temperature, and weather icon for each day.
Swipe-to-Refresh:

Allow users to manually update weather data by implementing swipe-to-refresh functionality.
Weather Data Retrieval
OpenWeatherMap API:

Use Retrofit or Volley for asynchronous network calls to fetch weather data.
Handle API responses and parse JSON to extract relevant weather information.
Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling for cases when weather data is unavailable or API requests fail.
Display meaningful error messages to users.
Location-based Weather
Location Services:

Utilize LocationManager or FusedLocationProviderClient to obtain the device's current location.
Update the UI with weather data based on the user's location.
User Search:

Implement a feature allowing users to search for weather by entering a city name.
Provide a user-friendly way to input location information.
Unit Conversion
Temperature Units:

Include an option for users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Implement corresponding UI elements (buttons or settings) to facilitate unit conversion.
Updated UI:

Dynamically update the UI to display temperature in the selected unit.
Testing
Unit and Instrumentation Tests:
Write tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the correctness of various functions.
Use Espresso for UI testing to validate user interactions and UI updates.
Error Handling and User Feedback
Error Messages:
Display informative error messages in case of network errors or invalid API responses.
Provide options for users to retry or refresh data.
Code Optimization
Performance Optimization:
Optimize code for better performance and efficiency.
Utilize appropriate data structures, caching mechanisms, and asynchronous processing to prevent UI freezes.
